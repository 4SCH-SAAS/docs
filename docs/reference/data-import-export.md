# Data Import & Export

Imports:
- Staff, students, subjects, and enrollments via CSV
- Templates downloadable from each import page

_Map CSV columns and resolve validation errors before import._
:::

Best practices:
- Normalize class/section names to avoid duplicates
- Keep unique identifiers stable across terms
- Test with a small file before full import

Exports:
- Standard reports as CSV/PDF
- Full data exports upon request (subject to permissions)
