# Roles & Permissions

Default roles:
- Admin: Full configuration and reporting
- Teacher: Classes, attendance, assessments, messaging
- Parent/Guardian: Child progress, messages, payments
- Student: Timetable, assignments, grades, messages
- Finance: Billing, payments, reports
- Registrar: Admissions, enrollment, transfers

Custom roles:
- Create roles with specific permissions
- Grant access by module and action (view, create, edit, approve)
- Assign roles per user; combine for broader access
