Onboarding stages:
- Setup: Establish academic and finance structure
- Data import: Staff, students, and historical data
- Training: Admins, teachers, and support staff
- Pilot: Run with a small cohort to validate workflows
- Rollout: Enable for all users, monitor adoption

Data import best practices:
- Use provided CSV templates to avoid mapping issues
- Validate email and phone formats for messaging
- Ensure unique identifiers (student number, staff ID)
- Upload documents (ID, medical notes) via Student Profile after import

User training plan:
- Admins: Academic setup, finance, permissions, reports
- Teachers: Attendance, assessments, gradebook, messaging
- Parents/Students: Portal overview, notifications, payments (parents)

Security and access:
- Use role-based permissions for least-privilege access
- Enforce MFA for Admins and finance roles
- Review audit logs weekly (Admin Console → Security → Audit)
